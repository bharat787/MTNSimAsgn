To run the simulation:
- Download the code to your local setup.
- Open the WSN-NSGA-III folder with MATLAB.
- Open to WSN-NSGA-III/code/configurationFile.m
- Run the code.

To see the results:
- Go to WSN-NSGA-III/results folder.
- Run any one of the following files:
- plotResuts3D_pareto.m to show the comparasion btween NSGAII,NSGA3and MOJPSO.
- MplotSensors.m to plot the sensor distribution for NSGA3.
- MplotStatistics.m to plot the execution time and sensors number statistics for NSGA3.
- plotResults2D.m to plot the pareto in 2D.

** The current code was simulated on matlab for linux based machine 
** if during the execution of the code it throws a path error for any 
** file just change the forward slash '/' to backward slash '\' in the path
