# MTNSimAsgn
Simulation of "Hybrid multi-objective evolutionary algorithms based on
decomposition for wireless sensor network coverage optimization"

The working matlab implementation of the code is in the folder WSN-NSGA-III. The plots-graphs folder includes all the simlulation results.

## To run the simulation:
- Download the code to your local setup.
- Open the WSN-NSGA-III folder with MATLAB.
- Open to WSN-NSGA-III/code/configurationFile.m
- Run the code.

## To see the results:
- Go to WSN-NSGA-III/results folder.
- Run any one of the following files:
  - plotResuts3D_pareto.m to show the comparasion btween NSGAII,NSGA3and MOJPSO.
  - MplotSensors.m to plot the sensor distribution for NSGA3.
  - MplotStatistics.m to plot the execution time and sensors number statistics for NSGA3.
  - plotResults2D.m to plot the pareto in 2D.
